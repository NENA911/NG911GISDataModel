The NENA Information Document for GIS Data Stewardship for Next Generation 9‑1‑1 
supports the development of complete, accurate and current GIS datasets to be 
used within NG9 1 1 systems. These datasets will be used to validate call 
location information, to route calls to the correct responding agency, and to 
display locations in context for call handling purposes. Following the 
recommendations presented will result in more accurate, efficient and 
reliable operation of GIS data dependent services within NG9 1 1 Systems.

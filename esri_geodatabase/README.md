# Esri GeoDatabase Template

This material contains both a template Esri File Geodatabase (FGDB) and the python script
used by the NENA Data Model Working Group to generate the FGDB. This Data Model is designed 
for users of Esri products but can also be consumed by a number of other open source GIS platforms.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

ArcGIS 10.2 or later, ArcGIS Pro 1.x or later

### Installing

The folder ending with the extension ".gdb" is the template Esri File Geodatabase.  
If only interested in the template Esri File Geodatabase itself, this and the files it contains
is the only content one needs to obtain.  The folder can be placed any where on the target machine
and then connected to via a suitable GIS application.

If interested in creating the template FGDB from a python script, one of the Dependencies should 
first be met.  Once either ArcGIS 10.2 (or later) or ArcGIS Pro 1.x (or later) has been installed
the esri_data_template_creation.py script can be downloaded

# NENA Ethics & Code of Conduct Policy

To work in 9-1-1 is to be part of one of the most important institutions in 
America and across the globe. Since the first 9-1-1 call was placed in 
February of 1968, untold millions of lives have been saved because of 9-1-1 
professionals’ dedication to public safety and service. NENA: The 9-1-1 
Association – comprised of its members, board, staff, volunteers, and event 
participants – is a community for all who are devoted to carrying this legacy 
forward and setting the standard for excellence in the industry. To do so, 
NENA strives to exemplify and embody the core values of respect, integrity, 
commitment, and cooperation.

Each association member, volunteer, and event attendee shall:

1. Represent the association honestly and professionally and refuse to 
   surrender any responsibility to special-interest or partisan political groups;
2. Avoid any conflict of interest or impropriety which could result from her or 
   his position, and refrain from using her or his status as an association 
   member for personal gain or publicity;

   reputation, or integrity of NENA, and respect the confidentiality of 
   confidential information obtained in the representation of the association;
4. Only exercise that authority which is lawful;
5. Abide by the bylaws, policies, and procedures of the association;
6. Foster an environment of cooperation and collaboration that engenders trust, 
   openness and confidence – one where diverse perspectives and views are 
   encouraged and valued;
7. Encourage the free expression, through proper channels and means, of 
   opinions held by others;
8. Faithfully and diligently perform all duties properly assigned;
9. Disclose and refuse any gift, loan, reward, or promise of future employment 
   offered in exchange for a commitment to vote or take any other action

    deliberations and actions free from bias, prejudice, harassment, and 
    discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender 
    identity, religion, disability, age, political affiliation, genetic 
    information, veteran status, ancestry, or national or ethnic origin.

    times;

    communications;

    facilitating growth, change, and innovation; developing leaders; driving 
    diversity; and creating community.

Individuals determined by the CEO, the Board of Directors, or its designee, to 
have violated the terms of this policy may, at NENA’s sole discretion, be 
subject to the application of measures that may include notification of the 
person’s agency or employer, forfeiture of event attendance, or revocation of 
membership. Should the NENA Board, or its designee, determine to remove an 
attendee from a NENA event or revoke membership, then it shall provide the 
affected person with an opportunity to respond to NENA’s concerns or allegations.
